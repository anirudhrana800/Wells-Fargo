In my virtual internship at Wells Fargo, I focused on creating and implementing a data model. I designed a structured database model to support specific business needs, ensuring data integrity and optimizing performance. I then implemented the model by writing SQL scripts for database creation and conducted testing to validate its functionality. This experience enhanced my skills in database design and practical application.
